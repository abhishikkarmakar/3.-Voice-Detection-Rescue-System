# Voice-Detection-Rescue-System
Developing a basic Voice Detection Rescue System in the next two hours will be ambitious but feasible with a simplified approach. Hereâ€™s a streamlined plan we can follow using available resources and tools:

### **1. System Design Overview**

#### **Objective:**
Create a basic prototype to detect and locate earthquake victims based on voice signals using available data and tools.

### **2. Technical Steps**

#### **Voice Recognition Setup**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Download Sample Audio Data:** Obtain voice and noise audio samples from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) or [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).
   - **Tools:** Use datasets such as UrbanSound8K or Speech Commands dataset for training.

2. **Voice Detection:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Use Python libraries to preprocess audio data (resampling, normalization). Libraries like `librosa` can help.
   - **Feature Extraction:** Extract features like MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) using `librosa` or `scipy`.

3. **Model Training:**
   - **Algorithm:** Use a simple classifier (e.g., Random Forest) or pre-trained model for voice detection.
   - **Libraries:** Use `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks. Train on features extracted from audio data.
   - **Code Example:**
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
     import librosa

     # Load data
     X, y = load_audio_data()  # Implement data loading

     # Feature extraction
     X_features = [extract_features(file) for file in X]

     # Train model
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_features, y, test_size=0.2)
     model = RandomForestClassifier()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Evaluate
     predictions = model.predict(X_test)
     print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)}')
     ```

#### **Hardware and Software Integration**

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - **Microcontroller:** Use a Raspberry Pi to interface with microphones and process data.
   - **Microphone:** Connect a USB microphone to capture audio.

2. **Software:**
   - **Python:** Develop the audio processing script to run on the Raspberry Pi.
   - **Libraries:** Install necessary libraries (e.g., `pyaudio` for real-time audio input).

   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio librosa scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - **Stream Audio:** Capture audio from the microphone in real-time using `pyaudio`.
   - **Processing:** Apply the trained model to classify audio data as voice or noise.

   ```python
   import pyaudio
   import numpy as np

   # Initialize audio stream
   stream = pyaudio.PyAudio().open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=44100, input=True, frames_per_buffer=1024)

   # Capture and process audio
   while True:
       data = np.frombuffer(stream.read(1024), dtype=np.int16)
       features = extract_features_from_audio(data)
       prediction = model.predict([features])
       print("Voice detected" if prediction == 1 else "No voice")
   ```

#### **Wireless Communication**

1. **LoRa Communication:**
   - **Setup:** Configure LoRa modules for wireless communication.
   - **Python Library:** Use `pyLoRa` for interfacing with LoRa.

   ```bash
   pip install pyLoRa
   ```

   ```python
   from pyLoRa import LoRa

   # Initialize LoRa
   lora = LoRa()
   lora.send_message("Voice detected")
   ```

### **3. Testing and Validation**

- **Test in Simulated Environment:** Ensure the system works by testing in a controlled setting with varying noise levels.
- **Fine-tune Model:** Adjust the model parameters and retrain if necessary based on testing results.

### **4. Summary**

This setup gives you a basic voice detection prototype for locating earthquake victims. The approach uses machine learning for voice recognition, integrates with hardware for real-time processing, and incorporates wireless communication for data transmission. Adjust and refine based on the testing feedback and available resources.
